## Code Validation

### HTML

I have used the recommended [HTML W3C Validator](https://validator.w3.org) to validate all of my HTML files.

## Bugs

- A bug I had was on the order summary page, in regards to the order total, delivery and grand total price.  

    - To fix this, I had to fix the indentation in the apps file inside the checkout folder.

- A bug I had was on the faqs page. Not as much of a bug , but I had hard coded the faqs into the file as well as having my models. 

    - I fixed this by removing the text from the faqs.html and using the model to its advantage on the admin side.

- A bug I had is with the webhook handlers. I have the code in the project although there is an issue on the webhook handler side.

    - I left the code in the project for now, and will fix this at a later stage as the emails are sending to your email for sign up and into the terminal.

- A bug I had is with the footer, while making the footer a size to fit all information needed inside, it has popped up slightly when you access the site on a tablet. This was effecting the view of the homepage image, pushing it up slightly.

    - I have fixed this by adding margin-top: 4em , so the image fits without distorting text or view.

## Unfixed Bugs

- A bug I had is with the webhook handlers. I have the code in the project although there is an issue on the webhook handler side.

    - I left the code in the project for now, and will fix this at a later stage as the emails are sending to your email for sign up and into the terminal.

- A bug I have last minute before submission was my footer popping up slightly when you bring it to tablet mode.

    - This happened by fixing a previous issue I had with the footer hiding some of the main text on the front image of the site. 

There are no remaining bugs that I am aware of.
